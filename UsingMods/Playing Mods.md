# Playing Mods

To play mods for Cursed Words, you will need to install [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README).

To install simply go to their [website](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README?id=automated-installation) download the install for your system, (top one for windows, bottom for linux), and then launch the installer.

This will launch the installer and prompt you with a games list, here you will select Cursed Words or Cursed Words Demo, and hit install.

Once this is done, download the relevent mods you wish to play.

Here is where it gets slightly tricky, open steam, and right click either Cursed Words or Cursed Words Demo (whichever one you installed melonloader to), and then hit Manage > Browse Local Files.

Here you will see the game files, what we are interested in however is the mods folder, so open that up, then move whatever mods you downloaded into this folder,  <img width="1595" height="849" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fa31cf-a774-4f04-850a-f5c291595f15" />

should look something like this,

Once this is done, you are officially ready to play!
